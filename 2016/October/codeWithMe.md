#Code With Me

This is a new twist on an old theme that we started back when we started. The change is a plan to pair an experienced coder with a new coder in order for the new coder to gain experience and for the experienced coder to stay in practice.

I believe we have java, C++, and assembly language, there may be some other programming languages that people have an interest in and we can certainly entertain them as a learning experience for everyone. This main idea is to have fun learning.
