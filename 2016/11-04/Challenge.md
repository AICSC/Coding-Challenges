### November 2016

There are *three* Code Challenges available this time:

## Polindromes

Write a program that will go through an array of strings and check to see if the strings within 
the array are palindromes. Print the number of palindromes in the array. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

Examples:
  * anna
  * racecar
  * level
  
## Number and Letter Count

Write a program that will go through a word and count how many characters are either a letter or number.

Examples: 

* "Jackson5"

The word "Jackson5" has 8 letters or numbers in the word.

* "dog#$%house34"

The word "dog#$%house34" has 10 letters or numbers in the word.

## Reverse a string

Write a program that reverses a string.
