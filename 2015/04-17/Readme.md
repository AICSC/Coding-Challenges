Write a simple, `Hello World` type program in a language you’re not familiar
with, ideally a language you have zero experience with.

Depending on your level of comfort/experience, you may think about trying:

 * Python
 * JavaScript
 * C
 * Ruby
 * Scala
 * Swift

Writing the code will not be the difficult part of this challenge.

The interesting part will be getting a small taste of something new, and sharing
about your experience with the rest of the group.

#### Jump Start

[TutorialsPoint.com](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) looks like
it might make for a good starting point. It appears to be able to compile and
run a number of different languages from it’s web interface.

This could help you short circuit the largest hurdle of just getting a new dev
toolchain setup on your machine.
