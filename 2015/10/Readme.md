### October 2015

There are *two* Code Challenges available this time:

## Distance Approximator

Given a specific distance (probably in feet, but bonus points for allowing multiple systems), compare that distance to something to compare that distance to that makes it easier to understand.

([Randall Munroe](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) does stuff like this all the time, and it is awesome!)

**Example:**
```
Enter a distance (ft): 650

650' is about as long as two football fields
```

```
Enter a distance (ft): 1200000

1,200,000' is about as far as the moon is from the earth
```

## Google's Blocky

I'm not sure what the challenge would be, but Google's [**Blocky**](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) looks pretty cool. It would be interesting to see what we could program using that.

Here's [an example](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/turtle?lang=en&level=2) of using **Blocky** to move a turtle around.
