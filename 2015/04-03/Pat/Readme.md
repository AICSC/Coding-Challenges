## [Swift](https://github.com/AICSC/Coding-Challenges/blob/master/2015/04-03/Pat/Calendar.swift)

This is the one I wrote *first*.

I tried to mix Swift and C conventions by putting all of my code inside functions, and even calling the `main` function to kick everything off. I *really* like this language.

## [C](https://github.com/AICSC/Coding-Challenges/blob/master/2015/04-03/Pat/Calendar.c)

This is the second version I wrote. Basically, how little can I change from the Swift version to get it to compile? Turns out, not too much.

Just need to add a lot of semicolons`;`
