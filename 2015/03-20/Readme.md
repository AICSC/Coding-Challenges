This program will not receive any user input.

Print the numbers from 1 - 100, each on a new line, with the following exceptions:

  * When a number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" in place of the number
  * When a number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" in place of the number
  * If a number is a multiple of 5 *and* 3, print "FizzBuzz"

This challenge was inspired by *[Using FizzBuzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding](http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/)* by Imran Ghory.
