## [C](https://github.com/AICSC/Coding-Challenges/blob/master/2015/03-20/Pat/FizzBuzz.c)

This one I tried to make as computationally simple as possible, at the expense of source readability. I do not use `modulo` at all, and avoid unnecessary evaluations where possible.

Have fun tracing :rage2:

## [Swift](https://github.com/AICSC/Coding-Challenges/blob/master/2015/03-20/Pat/FizzBuzz.swift)

Swift is a fun language to learn.

Here, I take advantage of Swift's ability to `switch` to anything (instead of just integers) to turn what would be a block of `if else` statements into a simple `switch case`

It all compiles the same, but it looks cool.

Also, I dig the `for i in 1...100` syntax.

## [C++](https://github.com/AICSC/Coding-Challenges/blob/master/2015/03-20/Pat/FizzBuzz.cpp)

This one is pretty standard. I used the Mendoza style *conditional with an empty string when false* idiom.
