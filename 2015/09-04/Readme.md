### September 4, 2015

There are *two* Code Challenges available this time:

## Bingo Card

Write a program (in any language) that randomly generates a [Bingo card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_card#75-ball_Bingo_Cards). The generated card need not be interactive.

## UI Design

Design (but *do not* code) a simple application (ie: a calculator). Create some mockups of what the user interface would look like, and explain how the application would be used, and what features would differentiate it from similar existing applications.

**No code should be written** for this application; this is purely about designing a mock up interface.
